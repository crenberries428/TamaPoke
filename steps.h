// Step counting from a 3-axis accelerometer.
//
// No Arduino dependency on purpose, like gbsynth: it takes samples and says how
// many steps they held, so steps_test can drive it with synthetic walking and
// the board feeds it from the QMI8658. The motion maths is the part worth
// testing; the I2C read is not.
//
// The signal is the magnitude of the acceleration, so it does not matter how the
// board is held, pocketed or strapped. Gravity is removed with a slow average,
// the rest is smoothed, and a step is a rise through a threshold after the
// signal has first dropped back. Four steps in a row at a walking cadence must
// be seen before any of them count: a shake, a bump or a fidget makes one or two
// peaks, never a run of four.

#define STEP_GOAL 10000        // the daily target the home screen's arc fills toward
#define STEP_MAX  99999        // what the counter holds; five digits is what fits the plate

class StepDetector {
 public:
  // One sample: acceleration in g on each axis and the time it was taken, in ms.
  // Returns how many steps to add (usually 0, 1 once walking, 4 when a run is
  // first confirmed). Irregular timing is fine; a gap over half a second
  // restarts the filters.
